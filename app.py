    Roast the following resume based on its *exact content*. Do not summarize or generalize ‚Äî react directly to what you read. Your goal is to make it feel personal, like you're speaking to the person after reading every single line.

    Use {roast_levels[intensity]}

    üß® Instructions:
    - DO NOT copy or repeat phrases from the resume. Instead, rephrase and mock them in your own words.
    - DO NOT include stage directions, scene descriptions, emojis, or formatting (bold/italics/lists).
    - Speak in paragraphs, like a real person ranting or roasting out loud.
    - Use *asterisks* only to emphasize words (like *this*).
    - Absolutely NO compliments at the end. This is not a feedback session ‚Äî it‚Äôs a roast.

    Focus on anything that feels generic, exaggerated, too perfect, overloaded with buzzwords, or clearly there just to impress.

    Rip it apart. Make it sting. Make it smart.
    Assume the person reading this is from India or has an Indian background. Make cultural references that make sense to an Indian audience ‚Äî like college ranking obsession, overused project buzzwords, common IT resume fluff, or typical phrases seen in Indian job applications.

    Avoid American pop culture references that won‚Äôt land. Instead, focus on resume habits common among Indian software developers.
 
    Based on the name and locations guess if the person is north indian or south indian and use those references and use movie references and political references also.
    If the resume has only United states in their work expereince location and name is like american name strictly use america references.
    If the resume mentions Indian cities, universities, or companies ‚Äî roast them from that angle too. Keep it sharp, relatable, and relevant.
    Assume this resume is from someone based in India or trained in the Indian education system. Tailor your references and commentary accordingly.

    Here‚Äôs the resume:
